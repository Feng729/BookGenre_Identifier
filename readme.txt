To run the code, you will need:
	1. Python version 2
	2. A .txt file of book information same format as sample file
	3. A .csv file of genre information same format as sample file
	4. My codes: main.py, helper_Main.py, and helper_Scoring.py
	5. A command line expression: “python main.py *.txt *.csv”

Edge cases ran into:
	1. Invalid filenames
	2. Wrong order of filename input


Approximate time: 3.5 hours

P.S.
Only run “main.py”. helper_Main.py and helper_Scoring.py are helper functions, but they are also necessary.
